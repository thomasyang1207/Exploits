# CS 450 project Exploit scripts

Scripts to reproduce several exploits. Run these on a virtual machine to prevent unintentional damage


These exploits can be successfully reproduced on Ubuntu 16.04. They are likely reproducible on other versions of Ubuntu after v14. 


## Initial setup

1. Install git on your machine

2. Clone this repo onto your virtual machine

3. (Only if you are performing forensics analysis) Execute "installSpade.sh" to setup SPADE provenance tracking tool

4. For each exploit inside the repo, follow the Readme.md inside each respective exploit directory to reproduce those exploits
